TODO:

Finish adding features from tutorial

Yank out all the oauth biz used in the guide. Only use Github oauth sauce

We'll be running this on a home server that will be on a separate subnet 
from all the other gadgets at home. Posts should be checked out from GitHub

Commit messages might be a legit source of content. Only the first commit msg.

Maybe just indicate if other commit messages were added? (just noting a thought nbd)
